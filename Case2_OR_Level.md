## Problem Set:
The problem set involves analyzing how OR level metrics have shifted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at Memorial Hospital. Specifically, the tasks include:

Calculate volume and distribution by level month over month for both the pre-COVID and COVID time periods at Memorial Hospital.
Calculate the average OR level in both the pre-COVID and COVID time period for the total OR population, elective procedure population, and non-elective procedure population for Memorial Hospital.
Calculate the average case charge for the pre-COVID and COVID time periods for the total OR population, elective procedure population, and non-elective procedure population.
Calculate the procedure mix between elective and non-elective procedures at Memorial for both the pre-COVID and COVID period.
Calculate the patient mix between inpatient and outpatient cases at Memorial in the pre-COVID and COVID timeframe.
Calculate the average case charges at Memorial and ABC Hospital during the COVID period and determine the total gross charge impact and total net revenue impact to Memorial Hospital of aligning its COVID average case charge with ABC Hospital's COVID average case charge.
## Goal:
The goal of the analysis is to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted OR level volumes, distributions, and charges at Memorial Hospital. Additionally, the analysis aims to compare Memorial Hospital's average OR case charges to those of ABC Hospital to ensure they remain competitive in the regional market.

## Data Description:
The data provided is in the form of an Excel file named "OR Levels". The data includes OR encounters at Memorial Hospital during the pre-COVID period of April 2019 - March 2020 and the COVID period of April 2020 - March 2021. Each encounter is identified by a Patient Account Number, Service Date, Patient Status, Procedure Specialty, Procedure Type, OR Level, Procedure Charge, and Case Charge.

## Data Dictionary:

Patient Account Number: A unique identifier for each patient encounter.
Service Date: The date on which the OR procedure was performed.
Patient Status: Indicates whether the patient was an inpatient or outpatient at the time of the procedure.
Procedure Specialty: Indicates the specialty of the procedure performed.
Procedure Type: Indicates whether the procedure was elective or non-elective.
OR Level: The level assigned to each procedure based on facility resource utilization and case complexity.
Procedure Charge: The charge for the procedure performed.
Case Charge: The total charge for all services rendered during the OR encounter, including the procedure charge, anesthesia and recovery charges, as well as charges for drugs and disposable supplies.
Note: For simplicity of the case, Memorial Hospital assigns the following OR levels to each of the procedure specialties: Orthopedics – Level 1, Gastroenterology – Level 2, General – Level 3, Cardiovascular – Level 4, and Thoracic – Level 5.
